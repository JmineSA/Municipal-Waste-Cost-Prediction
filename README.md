## 🏆 Model Performance

### Gradient Boosting (Cross-Validated)
**R² Score**: 0.681 ± 0.032 (5-fold CV)  
**Interpretation**:  
- Explains **68.1% of cost variance** in validation data  
- Outperforms baseline linear model (+22% R² improvement)  
- **Standard deviation** of 0.032 indicates stable predictions across folds

**Key Strengths**:  
✅ Handles non-linear relationships in waste cost drivers  
✅ Robust to outliers in municipal budget data  

**Comparison to Other Models**:  
| Model               | R² (CV)   | MAE ($)    | Training Time |
